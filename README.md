# Metin2-SendInput-
Sendint Input to Metin2 with C#

Hello, i didnt find anyone who made C# script where you can simulate keyboard press. 
I made little bit of research in pinvoke.net (take me about 3-4 days) and created this dll.
Whole guide is on youtube so you can have better understanding how to use this dll. (no need virus total)
Its in alpha so take it ez. Ofc there will be some bugs.
